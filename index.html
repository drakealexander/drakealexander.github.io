        <h2> Below is every attraction ive ever made, have fun!</h2>
        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/asteroids/">Asteroids</a>
        <p>Personal favorite right here, Asteroids was actually very hard to make and i needed a lot of help.</p>
        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/pong/">Pong</a>
        <p>Made Pong down in Oak Island NC when i was bored waiting for the Thanksgiving meal to be ready.</p>
        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/newtictactoe/">Tic Tac Toes</a>
        <p>I dont know why i wasted so much time and energy into this...</p>
        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/slide/">Sliding Puzzle</a>
        <p>If you're wondering how to play this, just try to get the numbers in order 1- how ever many you're playing to.</p>
        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/snake/">Snake</a>
        <p>One of the first things i made in HTML. Pretty basic.</p>
        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/bubshot/">Bubble Shooter</a>
        <p>Like those apps on our phone we all used to play the ones where you shoot certain colors at the bubbles with the same color. Yea like that.</p>
        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/newcalc/">Calculator</a>
        <p>Eh, needed to get through Geometry somehow, why not make my own Calculator.</p>
        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/platformer/">Platformer</a>
        <p>Everyone loves a platformer, right?</p>
        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/solitaire/">Solitaire</a>
        <p>I dont even play Solitaire why did i make this?</p>
        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/mindsweeper/">Mindsweeper</a>
        <p>Ah, the classic mindsweeper, a classic.</p>
