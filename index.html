	<h1>Hi! Welcome to my Index of every game I've ever made.</h1>
        <font face="helvetica" color="green">These are the very best things I've made.</font>
        <font face="arial" color="red">My name is Drake Griffith. I'm 14 and only in 9th grade, but I'm trying to manage school and coding.</font>
        <h2> Below is every attraction I've ever made, have fun!</h2>
        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/asteroids/">Asteroids</a>
        <p>Personal favorite right here, Asteroids was actually very hard to make, and I needed a lot of help.</p>
        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/pong/">Pong</a>
        <p>Made Pong down in Oak Island NC when I was bored waiting for the Thanksgiving meal to be ready.</p>
        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/newtictactoe/">Tic Tac Toes</a>
        <p>I dont know why I wasted so much time and energy into this...</p>
        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/slide/">Sliding Puzzle</a>
        <p>If you're wondering how to play this, just try to get the numbers in order 1- how ever many you're playing to.</p>
        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/snake/">Snake</a>
        <p>One of the first things I made in HTML. Pretty basic.</p>
        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/bubshot/">Bubble Shooter</a>
        <p>Like those apps on our phone we all used to play the ones where you shoot certain colors at the bubbles with the same color. Yes like that.</p>
        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/newcalc/">Calculator</a>
        <p>Eh, needed to get through Geometry somehow, why not make my own Calculator?</p>
        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/platformer/">Platformer</a>
        <p>Everyone loves a platformer, right?</p>
        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/solitaire/">Solitaire</a>
        <p>I dont even play Solitaire why did i make this?</p>
        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/mindsweeper/">Mindsweeper</a>
        <p>Ah, the classic mindsweeper, a classic.</p>
	<a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/dodge/">Dodger</a>
	<p>Dodge Game, try not to hit the fire!</p>
	<a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/click/">Clicker</a>
	<p>Offbrand Cookie Clicker game. Very basic but fun at the same time.</p>
	<a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/blockade/">Breakout</a>
	<p>???</p>
