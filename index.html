        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/asteroids/">Asteroids</a>
        <p>Personal favorite right here, Asteroids was actually very hard to make and i needed a lot of help.</p>

        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/slide/">Sliding Puzzle</a>  
        <p>If you're wondering how to play this, just try to get the numbers in order 1- how ever many you're playing to.</p>
        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/snake/">Snake</a>  
        <p>One of the first things i made in HTML. Pretty basic.</p>
        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/bubshot/">Bubble Shooter</a>
        <p>Like those apps on our phone we all used to play the ones where you shoot certain colors at the bubbles with the same color. Yea like that.</p>
        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/newcalc/">Calculator</a>  
        <p>Eh, needed to get through Geometry somehow, why not make my own Calculator.</p>  
        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/platformer/">Platformer</a>
        <p>Everyone loves a platformer, right?</p>
        <a href="https://drakealexander.github.io/solitaire/">Solitaire</a>
